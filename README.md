# multimedia-learning-game
An interactive learning game with multi-media resources.

*** WIREFRAME ***
(JPG included in separate file.)

*** USER STORY ***
"As a part of a diverse team, I want to make sure I can educate myself on vital topics and issues so I can do my part to make my organization as safe, productive, and healthy as possible. While playing the game, I will have opportunities to demonstrate my knowledge and to explore further resources in the areas I might have gaps."

*** INFLUENCES ***
SPENT the game, choose your-own-adventure games, trivia-style games, IXL-style (no losing, just different rates of achievement)

*** FURTHER RESEARCH NEEDED ***
More options for gamifying, more engaging elements, tone surveys for most accessible mood of challenging topics, etc. 

*** MVP DESCRIPTION ***
At minimum, the game must have:
1. Several questions, each with one right answer
2. A screen that displays "correct" or "incorrect"
3. A dynamic point tracker that shows how the player is doing throughout and how they did by the end. 

*** STRETCH GOALS ***
If time allows, I will add:
1. Implement smooth screen transitions between questions and resources.
2. Embed a variety of media for further learning and for reviewing topics before being asked a secondary answer!
3. Two paths per question: if wrong, send to additional resource then try asking another question covering the same topic, OR if correct, add point and progress to next question.
4. Mini-games throughout that drop the question format almost entirely but still assess and teach
