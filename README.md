An interactive learning game with multi-media resources.

*** USER STORY ***
"As a part of a diverse team, I want to make sure I can educate myself on vital topics and issues so I can do my part to make my organization as safe, productive, and healthy as possible. While playing the game, I will have opportunities to demonstrate my knowledge and to explore further resources in the areas I might have gaps."

Play as an employer or employee of an ambiguous organization. Move through the track of a day, interacting with a variety of people with various levels of power. 
For each interaction, based on the context, you have a variety of options on how to react to things happening around you. Options will be classified as CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROBLEM (slap on the wrist for a recurring issue, ignoring a problem, failing to prioritize important things, making spaces unsafe for others, etc.) or ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM (speaking up when you see something wrong, escalating issues when supervisors are not acting appropriately, leaving or refusing to support the organization if it is systematically oppressive and refuses to change.)

If a player chooses the path that CONTRIBUTES to the problem, possible repercussions are explained and a resource is provided to explain the nature of the situation more clearly. Then, they can go back and try again! Multiple correct and incorrect choices available for each scenario. 

*** INFLUENCES ***
SPENT the game, choose your-own-adventure games, trivia-style games, IXL-style (no losing, just different rates of achievement)

*** FURTHER RESEARCH NEEDED ***
More options for gamifying, more engaging elements, tone surveys for most accessible mood of challenging topics, etc. 

*** MVP DESCRIPTION ***
At minimum, the game must have:
1. Several questions, each with one right answer
2. A screen that displays "correct" or "incorrect"
3. A dynamic progress monitor that shows where they're at in the story and what resources they've unlocked access to. 

*** STRETCH GOALS ***
If time allows, I will add:
1. Implement smooth screen transitions between questions and resources.
2. Embed a variety of media for further learning.
